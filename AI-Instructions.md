# AI Vault Instructions - kotiansukesh/obsidian

## Vault Overview
This is a technical interview preparation vault with Java-focused content. Created Jan 2026. Total folders: 4 main categories. Use for coding practice, theory review, AI insights, and interview simulation.

## Folder Structure & Usage
- **AI/**: All AI/ML concepts, tools, papers, prompts. Use for: Explaining algorithms, generating AI code snippets, modern toolchains.
- **𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀/**: Java-specific coding patterns for LeetCode/HackerRank. Use for: Pattern matching, problem-solving walkthroughs, interview mock coding.
- **Interview Prep/**: Theoretical Q&A on Java, Spring Boot. Use for: Answering FAANG-style questions, explaining trade-offs, behavioral prep.
- **Java/**: Core Java concepts (OOP, collections, JVM, etc.). Use for: Debugging explanations, concept refreshers, code reviews.

## Query Guidelines
1. ALWAYS reference specific folders first (e.g., "Check Java/ for streams").
2. Prioritize Coding Patterns for algo problems; Interview Prep for theory.
3. Generate Java code from patterns; simulate interviews with Q&A format.
4. Cross-link: AI tools → Java implementations → Patterns application.
5. Output format: Clear steps, code blocks, explanations <5 sentences.
6. If unclear, ask: "AI folder or Java concepts?"

## Example Prompts
- "Simulate interview: Java Spring Boot singleton vs prototype."
- "Code sliding window from Coding Patterns."
- "Explain transformers from AI/ using Java analogies."

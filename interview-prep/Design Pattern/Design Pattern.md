# Design Pattern

### What Is a Design Pattern?
A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context.

### Advantages of Design Patterns
Using a design pattern has a few advantages. We get to use a solution that is known to work. The tradeoffs, if any, are well documented, so we do not stumble over problems that have already been solved. In addition, design patterns also serve as communication aids. Your project manager can say, "We will use a singleton,"" and that one word is enough to tell you what is expected.  
When books or web pages document patterns, they do so using a consistent format. We pay homage to this universal format by including sections for the

1.  Problem,
2.  Solution
3.  Benefits

of the singleton pattern. The Problem section explains why we need the pattern, what problem we are trying to solve. The **Solution** section explains how to implement the pattern. The **Benefits** section reviews why we need the pattern and how it has helped us solve the problem. Some of the benefits are hinted at in the **Problem** section. Others are additional benefits that come from the pattern.

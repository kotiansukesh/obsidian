# Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

**pre-requisite of methods declaration and passing**
six components in method declaration
- **Access Modifier** Defines **access type** of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application
	- **public** - accessible in all class in your application.
	- **protected** - accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es)(including subclasses declared outside the package)
	- **private** - accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
	- **default** (declared/defined without using any modifier) - accessible within same class and package within which its class is defined.

- **The return type** The data type of the value returned by the method or void if does not return a value.
- **Method Name** 
- **Parameter list**
- **Exception list**
- **Method body**

 - [[Encapsulation]]
 - [[Inheritance]]
 - [[Polymorphism]]

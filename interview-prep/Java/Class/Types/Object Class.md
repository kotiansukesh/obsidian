# Object Class

The base class of all Java features.

The Object class is the parent class or the first class in Java. It is at the topmost level of the Java hierarchy.

As all the classes have the Object class as a superclass, all Java objects inclusive of Arrays implement the Object class methods. The object class is present in the “java.lang” package.
